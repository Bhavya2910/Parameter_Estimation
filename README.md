# Parameter_Estimation


## Assignment Description:

This assignment focuses on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) in the context of two different probability distributions: the Normal distribution and the Binomial distribution.

### Questions:

1. **Normal Distribution**:
   Let (X1, X2,...,Xn) be a random sample of size n taken from a Normal Population with parameters: mean = μ and variance = σ^2. Find the Maximum Likelihood Estimates of these two parameters.

2. **Binomial Distribution**:
   Let X_1, X_2,...,X_n be a random sample from a Binomial distribution B(m, θ), where θ ∈ (0, 1) is unknown and ‘m' is a known positive integer. Compute the value of θ using the M.L.E.

In both cases, Maximum Likelihood Estimation provides a method for estimating parameters of probability distributions based on observed data. These estimates serve as the most likely values for the parameters given the observed sample, making MLE a fundamental tool in statistical inference.
